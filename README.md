# python-scripts
Here are some python scripts that I created and used for different tasks. 

Files

- decode.py is used for decoding from base16, base32 and base64 in plain text. Also you have the option to choose how many times that file needs to be decoded. So this script can be used for security purpose also and solving tasks when you have to decode same file many times.
